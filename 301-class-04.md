# Class 04 - React and Forms

## [React Docs - Forms](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html)

### 1. What is a ‘Controlled Component’?

Components that would handle their own state in HTML (like forms), but since React handles state at the component level, we set those components to be controlled by their React state.

### 2. Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why?

It depends on what the state is used for. For instance, if you have a search box that offers suggestions based on what the user has typed, it needs to update every time the input changes, but it doesn't need to run the search until the user submits the form.

### 3. How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?

The value of what the user entered can be accessed as `event.target.value`.

## [Conditional/Ternary Operator](https://codeburst.io/javascript-the-conditional-ternary-operator-explained-cac7218beeff)

### 1. Why would we use a ternary operator?

To reduce the space taken up by `if` statements, often to a single line.

### 2. Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement

`if(x===y){`
  `console.log(true);`
`} else {`
`console.log(false);`
`}`

Ternary statement:

`let x = y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false)`

## Things I want to know more about

Are there any situations where a ternary operator couldn't do the same job as an if statement?
