# Structuring Pages with HTML

## Wireframing

Wireframing is a way of planning a website that uses simple diagrams to understand how information will be laid out and how people will use the site. Wireframing uses UX research and focuses on how the user will (or should) interact with the site.

Your site should be clear and navigable before any formatting is applied, so for this process, simpler is better. Many designers start with paper and pencil, only moving to software when necessary. In some cases, designers will create simple prototypes of their site to test how it actually performs; in others, more detailed visuals will be tested before coding begins.

## Steps

1. **Research** who the site is for and what similar products exist.
2. **Record** your research somewhere thats easy for you to reference.
3. **Map** the flow you expect users to follow on your site. 
4. **Draft** the wireframe, making sure to stick to high-level features.
5. **Create and test** a simple version of the site 
6. **Prototype** your site for further testing.

## HTML

HTML pages are built out of HTML elements, indicated by tags. Some tags determine how the page will be read by a browser:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`
- `<html></html>`
- `<head></head>`
- `<meta charset="utf-8">`
- `<title></title>`

Other tags determine where text and images go:

- `<body></body>`
- `<p></p>`
- `<img>`
- `<ul></ul>`

And others apply formatting:

- `<strong>`

Elements can also be modified by attributes. Always ensure your elements are properly nested.

## Semantics

Semantics refers to the purpose or effect of a piece of code (not its literal text). In HTML, this comes into play with elements that have specific properties. Text enclosed in `<h1></h1>` tags will be read differently than identically-styled text enclosed in `<p></p>` tags. It's important to consider what a piece of code is supposed to do and make sure you're using the right language for the right functions.
