# Class 14a - CSS Transforms, Transitions, & Animations

## [CSS Transforms](https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/css-transforms/)

### 1. What does a CSS transform allow the developer to do to an element?

A CSS transform allows the developer to distort an element, either in two dimensions (like rotating the element, or making it bigger or smaller) or three (like making the element look like it's leaning away).

### 2. Provide an example of a transform and how you could see that being used on a website.

I might go back to the Odd Duck product survey page and add a hover effect to my images and buttons, so they grow a little when they're hovered over.

## [CSS Transitions & Animations](https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/transitions-animations/)

### 1. What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?

If an element changes "state" (for instance, if a link is hovered over), the transition between states can be controlled with CSS. For instance, if you have a button that changes color when it's hovered over, you could delay that transition.

### 2. How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?

Transitions only work when an element changes state, which means you only have one transition to work with. If the effect you want requires multiple states, you can use animations instead.

### 1. What are some benefits to using CSS transitions on websites?

They are simple to implement and increasingly widely-supported, and can increase user engagement with a site.

### 2. How this topic fit in with your long-term goals?

Very simply, I want to make things that people like looking at and using, and this seems like a fun way to do that that with tools I already know how to use.
