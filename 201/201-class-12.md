# Class 12 - Charts.js, Canvas

## [JavaScript Canvas](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/web-apis/javascript-canvas/>)

### 1. What does the `<canvas>` allow a developer to acheive?

Developers can use the `<canvas>` element to draw graphics using JavaScript.

### 2. What is the importance of the closing `</canvas>` tag?

Not all browsers support Canvas. The content between the opening and closing canvas tags allows you to set fallback content to display in those browsers.

### 3. Explain what the getContext() method does

The getContext() method tells the browser what kind of drawing/image is being created. We will probably be usng the "2d" context, which creates a canvas for two-dimensional images.

## [Create Animated Charts](https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2013/11/easily-create-stunning-animated-charts-with-chart-js/)

### 1. What are some advantages to displaying data via a chart over a table?

Charts are easier for people to read and understand quickly, and are often more visually interesting than tables.

### 2. How could Chart.js aid your previously created applications visually?

Charts could be useful in the Salmon Cookies sales-tracking app; I wouldn't replace the tables entirely, since it's important to be able to see the details, but charts could make a useful summary.
