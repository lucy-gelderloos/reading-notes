# Choosing a Text Editor

A text editor is one of the primary tools of a developer, but there are enough options that choosing one can be overwhelming. All operating systems come with a simple text editor, but there are much more advanced options with built-in tools and features to help you code.

## Available Features

Text editors can offer features such as auto-complete, which can automatically complete words you've typed before or even snippets of code; syntax highlighting, which uses text colors to differentiate elements of your code; and display options including themes that make staring at a screen all day more comfortable. Many text editors also allow the integration of extensions, which can add many more features and tools. 

## Integrated Development Environments

IDEs are suites of software that include text editors along with file managers, code compilers, and debuggers. They're probably overkill for simple web development projects, but as you get more advanced, they're worth looking at.

## How to Choose?

For very simple coding projects, you could use the text editor that comes with your computer, but for anything more complex, the tools included with a more advanced text editor will make you much more efficient. It can be a little overwhelming to choose, but many editors are free or have free versions, so you can check out lots of options before picking one:
