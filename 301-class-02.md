# Class 02 - State and Props

## [React Lifecycle](https://medium.com/@joshuablankenshipnola/react-component-lifecycle-events-cb77e670a093)

### 1. Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?

Render happens first.

### 2. What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?

The constructor of the component is called.

### 3. Put the following things in the order that they happen: `componentDidMount`, `render`, `constructor`, `componentWillUnmount`, `React Updates`

`Constructor`, `render`, `componentDidMount`, `React updates`, `componentWillUnmount`

### 4. What does `componentDidMount` do?

componentDidMount is invoked immediately after mounting, and is a good place for loading things that need a network request (like APIs).

## [React State vs. Props](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYvD9oBCuJI)

### 1. What types of things can you pass in the props?

Attributes or properties that you want the component to have.

### 2. What is the big difference between props and state?

Props are passed into a component, and state is handled inside the component.

### 3. When do we re-render our application?

The whole application re-renders when props are changed, while individual components re-render when their states change.

### 4. What are some examples of things that we could store in state?

Any properties or attributes that a user might change while interacting with the site

## Things I want to know more about

I'd like to get a clearer understanding of how the order of things happening in React affects how apps work and what the best practices are to avoid issues.
