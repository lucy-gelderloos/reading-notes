# What is Markdown?

Markdown is a way of telling computers how to format text, images, and other elements of a webpage or _____. It also determines the structure of the page, and can help in navigation.

## How does it work?

Markdown uses special characters such as `#`, `*`, or `()` to indicate how text should be formatted. For instance, a line of text with a single `#` in front of it will be formatted as a first-level heading; `##` indicates a second-level heading, and so on. A single word enclosed in `*` will be rendered in bold. \[another example - maybe blockquotes\]

## Formatting Text
