## [Microsoft Employees Protest Work With ICE](https://web.archive.org/web/20211124172013/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/19/technology/tech-companies-immigration-border.html)

In 2018, over 100 Microsoft employees posted an open letter protesting Microsoft's work with ICE because of the agency's child-separation policy. Microsoft executives, as well as other tech workers, leaders, and companies, also spoke up and raised money for immigrants; however, Microsoft did not cancel its contract with ICE, claiming that its work was entirely unrelated to the child separation activities. Ultimately, it appears that while a great deal of money was donated by individuals, the companies involved did not change, and in fact increased, their involvement with ICE.

As technology improves, we're able to gather and analyze more data than ever before, including data about people's behavior. Historically, people and companies have had to decide what data they wanted (sales numbers, customer opinion, etc.) and then work to collect it through tracking sales, surveying customers, or other methods. A key feature here is that people knew the data was being collected and what it would be used for. Now, companies and agencies can collect data first and analyze it later, and they can use it in ways people might not even have realized, like basing credit scores on shopping patterns.
