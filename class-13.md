# Class 13 - Local Storage

## [Local Storage and How To Use It on Websites]

### 1. Why would a developer use local storage for a web application?

The "state" of an HTML page (like any information a user has filled out) will reset every time the page is reloaded. In cases when we don't want that to happen, we can store information about the page's state either locally or on a remote server. Storing the information locally can save bandwidth, since the browser doesn't have to back and get it every time the page reloads.

### 2. What information should not be stored in local storage?

Sensitive and/or personal information.

### 3. Local storage can store what type of data? How would you convert it to that type before storing?

Local storage can only store strings, so if you're trying to store a different kind of data, convert it to a string first.
