# [AWS Amplify](https://beabetterdev.com/2021/09/22/what-is-aws-amplify/)

## 1. What are a few alternatives to AWS Amplify? What are the differences? What are the tradeoffs?

Amplify is a fullstack app toolkit that allows you to directly integrate with AWS services. There is a basic UI, but it's generally used as a CLI. Alternatives to AWS Amplify include Heroku, Netlify, and Firebase.

**Pros:** quick development and deployment, simpler way to interact with the AWS system

**Cons:** simplified AWS interaction means you don't learn as much about using AWS, works best for individual projects rather than collaboration with other developers, implementing AWS features not supported in Amplify can be tricky, and billing can be difficult to understand.

## 2. What AWS Region is closest to you?
