## [Big O: Analysis of Algorithm Efficiency](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-05/resources/big_oh.html)

The efficiency of an algorithm is evaluated based on running time and memory space, expressed in Big O notation. Big O notation looks at the worst-case performance scenario for the algorithm's efficiency, looking at the 4 key areas below.

1. **Input size** refers to both the number of parameters and the size of each parameter (for instance, the size of an array)
2. **Units of measurement:**
    A. Running time is measured in:
        i. The *time in milliseconds* it takes to run (while it is an important measurement, it is not part of Big O because it varies depending on hardware)
        ii.  The *number of operations*
        iii. The *number of basic operations*, where "basic operations" are the ones that contribute most to the running time
    B. Memory space is measured in the amount of space needed to hold:
        i. The *code for the algorithm*
        ii. The *input data* (can be referred to as additional memory space if function doesn't have direct input value)
        iii. The *output data*
        iv. *Working space* during calculation
3. **Orders of growth** represent the increase running time or memory space as input size `n` increases.
4. Best case, worst case, and average case
