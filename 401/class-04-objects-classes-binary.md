## [Java Classes](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/classes.html)

Classes have:

- fields
- a constructor
- methods

Classes can extend (be subclasses of) other classes, which allows the subclass to use the fields and methods of the parent class.

## [Binary, Decimal, and Hexadecimal Numbers](https://www.mathsisfun.com/binary-decimal-hexadecimal.html)

Decimal numbers (aka base ten) use the symbols 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. To express a number greater than nine, we use the next "place" to specify how many tens, 100s, etc. are in the number.

Binary numbers (aka base two) only use the symbols 0 and 1. Again, to express a higher number, we move a place to the left - zero is 0, one is 1, two is 10, three is 11, four is 100, etc.

Hexadecimal numbers (aka base 16) uses the symbols 0-9, plus a, b, c, d, e, and f to express high numbers in a more compact format. For instance, two hundred and fifty in hexadecimal is FA; one million is F4240.
