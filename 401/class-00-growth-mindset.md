*Deliberate practice* refers to activities designed to improve performance, that push you out of your comfort zone, can be repeated, and have continuous, clear feedback. Another key feature of deliberate practice is the difficulty level - while problems that are too difficult won't help you build skills, neither will challenges that are too easy.

## [Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset](https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve?language=en)

- A growth mindset sees challenges as an opportunity to develop the abilities being challenged
- Students with a fixed mindset would refuse to engage with a difficult problem rather than try to figure out how to address it

## [Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit](https://www.ted.com/talks/angela_lee_duckworth_grit_the_power_of_passion_and_perseverance)

- Grit is having the stamina to persevere and pursue long-term goals
- Grit is not necessarily related to talent
- People who understand learning as a process that can be practiced and improved over time are better at both learning and at persevering in challenging situations

## [Alain de Botton  on Redefining Success](https://www.ted.com/talks/alain_de_botton_a_kinder_gentler_philosophy_of_success?subtitle=en)

- There's a lot of pressure to have an impressive job
- There's also a belief that people who don't have impressive jobs (or the monetary rewards that come from an impressive job) are in that position because they aren't smart or hardworking enough
- Make sure that you're judging your life based on your own vision of success, not others'

## Emotional Intelligence

My score on the assessment hasn't really changed since the last time I took it. The areas I most need to improve are handling tense situations and conflict, and fortunately, I haven't had to deal with any of those recently.

*In most situations, I have strong emotional intelligence; however, when emotions start running high (either my own or others'), I tend to shut down. When I get upset or frustrated, it becomes difficult for me to communicate (and I often start crying, which feels embarrassing and doesn't help with communication). I don't raise my voice or otherwise direct my stress at other people, but it's still difficult to have emotional discussions.*

*I also have a very hard time if someone else is frustrated and raises their voice, sometimes to the point of having to leave the room. While I know I'm not required to accept yelling in the workplace, I want to be able to respond to this kind of thing productively rather than running away.*

## Reflecting on Bias

My score on the bias assessment is pretty much the same as last time (see below). As with the emotional intelligence reflection, I haven't had any opportunities to work on my weakest area, which is intervening when I see bias happening.

*I scored fairly well on identifying and understanding bias. The area where I most need to improve is taking more action. When things get uncomfortable or confrontational, my instinct is to always smooth things over, which can lead to bias going unchallenged or marginalized colleagues being further marginalized. I also haven't sought out chances to actively fight bias at work, like joining diversity committees or looking for mentorship opportunities.*
