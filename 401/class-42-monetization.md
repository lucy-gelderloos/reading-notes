# Class 42 - Ads and Monetization

## [Google AdMob](https://developers.google.com/admob)

AdMob allows you to integrate ads into your app, either from Google advertisers generally or from premium ad networks. You can choose from various ad templates and integrations to ensure the ads aren't too obnoxious, and can modify the layouts without republishing the app. Ads can be scaled up to reach different audiences as the app's popularity grows, and can be used to cross-promote any other apps. AdMob also provides reporting tools.

Along with ads, apps can be monetized using in-app purchases, subscriptions, premium versions, and of course requiring people to pay for the app itself. Within the subscription model, you can provide introductory pricing/free trials, and promo codes. Integrating with Google's payment, analytics, and other services makes the purchasing experience smooth for users and developers.
