# Contributing to Open Source Software

Contributing to open-source software is a great way to meet other developers, build a resume, and contribute to meaningful projects. It can also be a bit intimidating, especially for developers early in their careers.

Developers on GitHub may tag open issues as "good first issue." To make a contribution, follow all available guidelines; if no specific guidelines are available for that project, follow the basic "fork - clone - edit - pull" workflow described at the [First Contributions GitHub Repo](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions).
