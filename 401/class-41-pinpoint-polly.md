# Class 41 Reading Notes - Amazon Pinpoint; Amazon Polly

## [Amazon Pinpoint](https://aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/)

Pinpoint provides the ability to communicate with customers at scale. It provides tools to aggregate, automate, and personalize customer communications across a number of channels, including email, SMS, and in-app messaging. It also provides engagement data to understand when and how customers are interacting with the messaging. Use cases include sending unique login links, updating customers about everything from news stories to the status of a delivery, and collecting segmented user data.

Polly is a cloud service that provides text-to-speech service, with the option of many human-like voices (including at least one male and at least one female voice in most languages). This service can be used for news readers, accessibility apps, and IoT devices, among many other applications. Polly is certified for use with sensitive data governed by HIPAA and PCI DSS. It has high accuracy when working with complicated text like abbreviations, dates, and acronyms.
