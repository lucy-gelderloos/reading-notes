# Class 15 - Authentication

## [What is OAuth](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3216404/what-is-oauth-how-the-open-authorization-framework-works.html)

### 1. What is OAuth?

A third-party protocol that allows servers and services to confirm that a user is authorized/authenticated without handling the authentication themselves.

### 2. Give an example of what using OAuth would look like

Using either Google or GitHub to log into a service like MongoDB or Heroku.

### 3. How does OAuth work? What are the steps that it takes to authenticate the user?

When a user attempts to access a website, the website will send an authentication request via OAuth to a site the user is already authorized on (like Google, Facebook, or GitHub). If OAuth confirms that the user has been authorized on the other site, the first site will allow access.

### 4. What is OpenID?

OpenID is an authentication service that allowed people to log into many different sites; OAuth provides authorization for websites to log into other sites on behalf of the user.

## [Authorization and Authentication Flows](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow)

### 1. What is the difference between authorization and authentication?

Authentication verifies that a person is who they say they are, while authorization determines what the user has access to (and usually happens after authentication).

### 2. What is Authorization Code Flow?

When the user clicks a login link, the site they're trying to log into sends a request to to Auth0, which sends back an athorization prompt to the user. When the user has authenticated, Auth0 sends an authorization code to the to the site, which sends back the code along with a client ID and secret token. Once the code, ID, and secret are authorized, Auth0 sends an ID and access token that the site the user is logging into can send to the API to confirm they're authorized to access that information.

### 3. What is Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)?

PKCE adds an extra layer of security for sites that don't have a way to securely store login info. Instead of using client IDs and client secrets, PKCE sends randomly-generated codes and code challenges.

### 4. What is Implicit Flow with Form Post?

When the user clicks the login link, the app sends a request to Auth0, which returns an authentication request. When the user authenticates, Auth0 sends an ID token to the app. Only use this method if your app has a way to store the ID token securely.

### 5. What is Client Credentials Flow?

This is used in machine-to-machine (M2M) authentications. The app that is trying to access a resource sends its client ID and client secret to Auth0, which sends back an access token that lets the app access the resource.

### 6. What is Device Authorization Flow?

A flow for situations when users are trying to log in to devices that don't allow traditional input (as in, there's no keyboard to enter a username and password). The device's app sends a request to Auth0, then sends back a user code and a URL the user can use to log in using a browser or smartphone. When the user goes to the browser, enters their code, and authenticates, Auth0 marks the device as authorized and sends an access code to the device's app; the app uses the access code to retrieve data.

### 7. What is Resource Owner Password Flow?

This flow requires the user to enter their username and password, which are sent to Auth0 for validation. Auth0 provides an access token , which the app uses to request data. **Because this method involves sending the user's credentials, it should only be used in trusted applications.**

## Things I'd like to know more about

I haven't tried to implement this in an app yet, so I'd like to know more about that.
