# Passing Functions as Props

## [React Docs - lists and keys](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html)

### 1. What does .map() return?

.map() returns a new array.

### 2. If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?

Enclose the array in curly braces, and enclose that in an HTML tag:

`<div>{array}</div>`

### 3. Each list item needs a unique *key*

### 4. What is the purpose of a key?

Keys give items in React a unique identifier, so they can be tracked even if their value changes. If the item already has an id, that can be used as the key; the item's index should not be used if there's any chance of the item order changing. Keys don't need to be globally unique, but should be unique among their sibling items.

## [The Spread Operator](https://medium.com/coding-at-dawn/how-to-use-the-spread-operator-in-javascript-b9e4a8b06fab)

### 1. What is the spread operator?

An ellipsis (`...`) that expands an object into the list of arguments.

### 2. List 4 things that the spread operator can do

- Combining/concatenating arrays
- Adding items to lists
- Adding to state in React
- Using Math functions

### 3. Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays

`let arr1 = [1, 2, 3];`
`let arr2 = [4, 5, 6];`
`let newArr = [...arr1,...arr2];`

`newArr` will be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

### 4. Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array

`let arr1 = [4, 5, 6]`
`let newArr = [1, 2, 3,...arr1]`

`newArr` will be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

### 5. Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one

`let obj1 = {firstName: Lucy}`
`let obj2 = {lastName: Gelderloos}`
`let obj3 = {...obj1,...obj2}`

`obj3` will be an Object with properties `{firstName: Lucy, lastName: Gelderloos}`

## [How to Pass Functions Between Components](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c05OL7XbwXU) (video)

### 1. In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components?

Creates a new function at the level of the state he wants to change.

### 2. In your own words, what does the `increment` function do?

It finds an object in the array whose 'name' property matches the name passed to the function, then increments that object's 'count' property by one. It then updates the state with the new value.

### 3. How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component?

Add a prop to the child component that refers to the method (using `this.method`).

### 4. How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component?

By accessing the prop that refers to the method and passing in any arguments it needs (`this.props.method(argument)`).

## Things I want to know more about

I'd like to dig more into how spread notation can work with props.
