# Code 301 Class 01 - Introduction to React and Components

## [Component-Based Architecture](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/component_based_architecture.htm)

### 1. What is a “component”?

A component is a software object that has a specific function that it performs independently. Like mechanical components, software components can be removed or replaced, and can be used across different projects/applications. If part of an architecture, conforms to other components in the architecture.

### 2. What are the characteristics of a component?

- **Reusable:** where possible, components are designed to be reusable in different applications
- **Replaceable:** components can be swapped out with other components
- **Context-agnostic:** components can work in different environments
- **Extensible:** components can be expanded to behave differently
- **Encapsulated:** components only show their interface, not internal processes, variables, or state
- **Independent:** components depend as little as possible on other components

### 3. What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?

Because components work independently as much as possible, they can be upgraded or replaced without requiring an upgrade to the whole system. Systems can use and reuse components from multiple sources, reducing the need to develop each part of the system from scratch.

## [What is Props and How to Use it in React](https://itnext.io/what-is-props-and-how-to-use-it-in-react-da307f500da0)

### 1. What is “props” short for?

Properties

### 2. How are props used in React?

Props can be passed to components in the same way that arguments are passed to functions. An attribute is created with a property and a value, then passed to the component.

### 3. What is the flow of props?

Props data is read-only (can't be modified) and passes only from parent to child.

## Things I Want To Know More About

I'd like to see some real-life uses of props - I'm having trouble conceiving how it works from the example.
