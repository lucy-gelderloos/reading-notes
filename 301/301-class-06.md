## [Pair Programming](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)

### 1. What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?

1. Increasing efficiency by reducing time spent troubleshooting and debugging
2. Keeping developers engaged by talking through problems
3. Sharing knowledge between developers
4. Improving social skills by requiring collaboration
5. Preparing for pair programming exercises in interviews
6. Training with more experience developers

### 2. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?

Every time we've done a pair programming exercise, I've learned a new way of doing something from my partner.

### 3. How does pair programming work?

There's a driver and a navigator. The driver types the code and handles the files, while the navigator guides the driver while keeping in mind the larger purpose of the code (and scanning for bugs and typos).

## Things I want to know more about

I'm interested to see how we'll be able to expand our apps once we have the ability to run code on the server.
