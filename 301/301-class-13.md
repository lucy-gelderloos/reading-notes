# Class 13 - More CRUD

## [CRUD Basics](https://medium.com/geekculture/crud-operations-explained-2a44096e9c88)

### 1. Which HTTP method would you use to update a record through an API?

UPDATE replaces the resource's data with new data.

### 2. Which REST methods require an ID parameter?

UPDATE and DELETE need ID parameters to make sure they're acting on the right resource.

### 1. Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?

CRUD is the create/read/update/delete cycle - the four main ways to interact with databases. REST is a way of designing software that uses the HTTP protocol, often with functions similar to CRUD functions. REST APIs also have access to functions beyond CRUD.

### 2. If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?

1. Define what information you're storing (photos, recipes, orders) & where you'er storing it
2. Set up and test the routes to access the API
3. Create a schema
4. Set up CRUD functions and error handlers
5. Test all functions of the database
